# ScrapeTheNews

## Purpose/Information:
The main drive behind this news scraper is to customize the way you receive your daily top stories. This app allows you interact with others by leaving comments on individual news articles and get the latest  headlines at the click of a button. 

## Functionality:
You start off with a simple webpage and at the center of it there's a button that allows you to start scraping your news headlines. You can click that same link as many time as you'd like to refresh your headlines. Each article is presented alongside it's own buttons. One which takes you to a comment page. Here you are able to leave your own opinion as well as read other's comments. The second button takes you directly to the story to read. 

## Technologies: 
* JavaScript
* Express
* Handlebars
* MongoDB
* Cheerio

## Nice-to-haves:
I would like to add a save functionality where the user saves their favorite articles. Also, make my web page more appealing by adding an image as well as bried summary.
